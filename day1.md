1Ô∏è‚É£ DSA (2 Pattern-Based Problems)
Problem 1: Two Sum (Two Pointers / Hashing Pattern)

Problem Statement:
Given an array nums and a target t, find indices of two numbers such that they add up to target t.

Hints:

Can we solve it in O(n) using extra space?

Use a hash map to store seen numbers.

C++ Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    unordered_map<int,int> mp;
    for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if(mp.find(complement) != mp.end())
            return {mp[complement], i};
        mp[nums[i]] = i;
    }
    return {};
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2,7,11,15};
    int target = 9;
    vector<int> res = twoSum(nums, target);
    for(int idx : res) cout << idx << " ";
    return 0;
}


Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
Edge Cases: Negative numbers, duplicates, no solution
Common Mistakes: Forgetting to store index, checking complement after storing current number

Problem 2: Reverse Linked List (Linked List Pattern)

Problem Statement:
Reverse a singly linked list.

Hints:

Use three pointers: prev, curr, next.

Traverse once, change next pointers.

C++ Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x): val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
    ListNode *prev = NULL, *curr = head, *next;
    while(curr) {
        next = curr->next;
        curr->next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }
    return prev;
}

// Helper to print list
void printList(ListNode* head) {
    while(head) {
        cout << head->val << " ";
        head = head->next;
    }
}

int main() {
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(1);
    head->next = new ListNode(2);
    head->next->next = new ListNode(3);
    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(4);

    head = reverseList(head);
    printList(head);
    return 0;
}


Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Edge Cases: Empty list, single node
Common Mistakes: Forgetting to update next pointer, losing head reference

2Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Task (1 Query Example)

Problem: Get top 3 highest-paid employees from Employees table.
Hints: Use ORDER BY and LIMIT.

Stepwise Query Evolution:

-- Step 1: Basic select
SELECT * FROM Employees;

-- Step 2: Order by salary descending
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;

-- Step 3: Limit to top 3
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 3;


Optimization Tips:

Use index on Salary for large tables.

For ties, consider RANK() function.

3Ô∏è‚É£ CS Core (OS) Notes + 5 Q&A

Short Notes:

Process vs Thread: Process = independent, Thread = lightweight within process

Deadlock Conditions: Mutual exclusion, Hold & wait, No preemption, Circular wait

Paging: Fixed-size memory blocks to avoid fragmentation

Scheduling: FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority

5 Q&A:

Q: What is context switching?
A: Saving current process state, loading next process state.

Q: Difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?
A: Preemptive can interrupt, non-preemptive waits till completion.

Q: What is a semaphore?
A: Synchronization tool to control access to shared resource.

Q: Starvation vs Deadlock?
A: Starvation = low priority waits indefinitely, Deadlock = circular wait.

Q: What is thrashing?
A: Excessive paging causing low CPU utilization.
